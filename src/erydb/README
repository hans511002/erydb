This is erydb 5.1.1
erydb 5.1.1is the development version of erydb. 
It is built by porting EryDB 4.6.7 on MariaDB 10.1.19 and adding entirely 
new features not found anywhere else.

erydb 5.1.1 is an GA release. This is the first MariaDB 
EryDB release, not all features planned for the erydb 5.0 
series are included in this release. 

Additional features will be pushed in future releases. 
A few things to notice:
- Do not use alpha releases on production systems.
- The building of the EryDB engine needs a special build environment. We're working on making it available for everyone to build.
